        <b><a href="https://www.cusacklab.org/">Rhodri Cusack</a></b> is the Thomas Mitchell Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at Trinity College Dublin, and Director of the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience. His team studies how the brain and mind develop in infants using neuroimaging and online testing. The goals are to understand healthy development and to provide tools for earlier diagnosis in the neonatal intensive care unit. Rhodri studied physics at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and then obtained a PhD in psychology from the University of Birmingham. He was then a postdoctoral fellow and subsequently group leader at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge, and then an Associate Professor at the Brain and Mind Institute of the University of Western Ontario. He joined Trinity College in 2017. His research has been funded by the ERC, SFI, IRC, MRC, Wellcome Trust, BBSRC, EPSRC, CIHR, and NSERC. He has 136 peer-reviewed publications.

        <img src="images/Piotr.jpeg" class="speaker-profile">
        <b><a href="https://piotrmirowski.com/">Piotr Mirowski</a></b> is a Staff Research Scientist at Google DeepMind, a Visiting Researcher and Knowledge Exchange Scholar at Goldsmiths, University of London, and the co-founder and Director of Improbotics. His research on artificial intelligence covers the subjects of reinforcement learning, navigation, weather and climate forecasting, as well as a socio-technical systems approach to human-machine collaboration and to computational creativity. He is the author of over 75 papers that have been published in prestigious journals including Nature. Piotr studied computer science in France at ENSEEIHT Toulouse and obtained his PhD in computer science in 2011 at New York University, with a thesis supervised by Prof. Yann LeCun (Outstanding Dissertation Award, 2011). A trained actor himself (London School of Dramatic Art), Piotr created Improbotics, a theatre company where human actors and robots improvise live comedy performances and investigate the use of AI for artistic human and machine-based co-creation, aiming at bridging the arts and sciences.

        <b><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Qkk6DcAAAAJ&hl=en">Katharina Duecker</a></b> is now a postdoc with Stephanie Jones at Brown University, developing biologically plausible models of the neural circuitry underlying oscillatory dynamics in the neocortex. She got her PhD with Ole Jensen on the role of neuronal alpha and gamma oscillations in visual cortex using MEG, frequency tagging and computational modelling. She has transitioned from cognitive neuroscience and psychology to a deeper interest in neurophysiology and neural computation. She got her BSc Psychology at Bielefeld University, Germany, where she worked with the Neurocognitive Psychology group on visual search, psychophysics, using eye tracking. She got her MSc in Neurocognitive Psychology at the University of Oldenburg, where she worked in the Experimental Psychology group led by Christoph Herrmann, investigating alpha oscillations using MEG/EEG and transcranial alternating current stimulation.

        <b><a href="https://catrinahacker.com/">Catrina Hacker</a></b> is a PhD candidate in the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Neuroscience Graduate Group. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience from the University of Southern California where she worked on several projects developing neurocomputational accounts of face processing.  Her thesis work at Penn has focused on understanding the adaptive brain mechanisms that make cognitive processes like visual memory sensitive to changes in the environment.
